## Hi I'm Kaitlyn Rohm ðŸ‘‹
<p>I'm a student in mission ready doing the advanced full stack developer course. I am about to start an internship at Manana games and I'm looking forward to all the things I can learn!</p>

####Skills
<p>I have done several projects with mission ready which have given me lots of unique skills. These skills include using react.js, node.js, plain javascript, html and css. I have also used mySql and mongodb. During the course of the missions I also used google gemini and the maps api.</p>
